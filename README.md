# rules of thumb for circuit diagrams

Red wire:     Used to show connection with positive terminal

Blue wire:    Used to show connection to ground

Yellow wire:  Used to show connection with GPIO pin

White wire:   Used to show circuit's internal wiring 

Resistors:    Four band color coding is used to show the resistence (<a href="http://www.circuitstoday.com/resistor-color-code-chart">details</a>)


# blink.c
Simple program which is "HELLO WORLD" equivalent in programming raspberry pi.

Resistors used: 10k立 (Brown, Black, Orange) and 1k立 (Brown, Black, Red)

Led used: Normal led (bent wire is anode)

# input.c
Program to take input from the user using a pushbutton/switch.

Resistors used: 10k立 (Brown, Black, Orange) and 1k立 (Brown, Black, Red)

Pushbutton: Two pin pushbutton/switch
