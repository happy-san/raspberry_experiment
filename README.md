# conventions for circuit diagram

Red wire:     Used to show connection with positive terminal

Blue wire:    Used to show connection to ground

Yellow wire:  Used to show connection with GPIO pin

White wire:   Used to show circuit's internal wiring 

Resistors:    Four band color coding is used to show the resistence (<a href="http://www.circuitstoday.com/resistor-color-code-chart">details</a>)


# blink.c
Simple program which is "HELLO WORLD" equivalent in programming raspberry pi.

Circuit Diagram

Resistors used: 10kΩ (Brown, Black, Orange) and 1kΩ (Brown, Black, Red)

Led used: Normal led (wire which is bent is anode)
